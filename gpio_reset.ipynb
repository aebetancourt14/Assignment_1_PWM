from pynq.overlays.base import BaseOverlay

following the previous lab, gpio, inlcuded the base overlay and initialize microblaze for c++ code.  


%%microblaze base.PMODA


###include <iostream>
using namespace std;

###{
    cout << "HelloWorld" << endl;
    return 0;
}

error message from trying to run c++ code to test if it works: 
        "Compile FAILED
        Preprocessor failed: 
        cell_magic:4:10: fatal error: iostream: No such file or directory
        compilation terminated."
below im checking with version of c++ compiler is installed on the board(from chatgpt).
also pointed out running baremetal or microblaze instace of 

!which g++
!g++ --version


also was pointed out that running baremetal embedded kernal or microblaze instace kernal do not support <iostream>.  c++ headers not able to run in this environment. below is the fix to remove it from the code: 

%%microblaze base.PMODA
#include "pyprintf.h"

int test_func(){
    for (i=0; i<8; i++)
    {
       int 1 = 42;
       pyprintf("x = %d\r\n", x); 
    }
    return x;
}

Notes: creating multiple "main()" fucntion will cause the compiler error message: 
        Compile FAILED
        cell_magic:33:9: error: redefinition of 'int main()'
        cell_magic:4:5: note: 'int main()' previously defined here
    Fix: just use one "main()" or dont use "main()" at all and use named functions in your code.

%%microblaze base.PMODA
#include "pyprintf.h"
#include "gpio.h"

const unsigned int PMODA_BASE_PIN = 0;
const unsigned int PMODA_PIN_COUNT = 8;

 void gpio_reset(){
   for (unsigned int i=0; i<PMODA_PIN_COUNT; i++)
     {
        pyprintf("pin number %u being rest to 0\r\n", i);
        unsigned int pin_num = PMODA_BASE_PIN + i;
        gpio g = gpio_open(pin_num);
        gpio_set_direction(g, GPIO_OUT);
        gpio_write(g, 0);    //sets pinstate to 0
     }
    pyprintf("pin values have been reset to 0 on PMOD A\r\n");
  }
void pmoda_write(unsigned int pin, unsigned int val) {
    gpio g = gpio_open(pin);
    gpio_set_direction(g, GPIO_OUT);
    gpio_write(g, (val ? 1 : 0));
}

gpio_reset()

im able to set the pins on PMOD A to zero with the above function. 
I dont see any of the pyprintf statements being output when running function, not entirely sure i know why. 

below is the python pwm cycle emulate program.  
given that:
        period (T): T = 1/(frequency)
        ![image.png](attachment:image.png)

import time 

def pwm_cycle(pin_pwm=3, freq_hz=100, duty_cycle=10, duration_s=1):
    ## force pmoda pins 2 & 4 low; only have green on
    pmoda_write(2, 0)
    pmoda_write(4, 0)
    
    period = 1.0 / freq_hz
    T_on = period * (duty_cycle / 100.0)
    T_off = period - T_on
    #edge cases for 0 and 100 duty_cycle
    if duty_cycle <= 0.0:
        pmoda_write(3, 0)
        time.sleep(duration_s)
    if duty_cycle >= 100.0:
        pmoda_write(3, 1)
        time.sleep(duration_s)
    
    end_time = time.perf_counter() + duration_s
    pmoda_write(pin_pwm, 0 )
    print("before while\r\n")
  
    while time.perf_counter() < end_time:
        if T_on > 0:
            pmoda_write(pin_pwm, 1)
            time.sleep(T_on)
            
        if T_off > 0:
            pmoda_write(pin_pwm, 0)
            time.sleep(T_off)
            
    print("outside while\r\n")        
    pmoda_write(pin_pwm, 1)  

notes: switching between languages i got confused with the formatting and semicolon usage. not the best at keeping things aligned was a big learning curve for me. inlcuded some print statements for debug purposes.

### adjusting the "duty_cycle" value will adjust the brightness of the LED.  
percieved visual brightness is logarithmic in scaling (according to the article: Why You Need Dimming Curves(AcuityBrands))
![image.png](attachment:image.png)
at low measured values of light, human eye percieves it as being brighter than it is. 
i itereated through the various dutycyle percentages and capture my percieved brightness for the LED include in the chart below: duty cycle (%)	percieved brightness
           0	             0
           5	             10
           10	             10
           20	             30

 below is implementing the existing code with async example to attempt at adding the required functionality:
        Start the code and blink the LED’s red channel in intervals of 1 second (i.e. 1 second on, 1 second off)
        When buttons 0, 1, or 2 are pushed, the LED will change color from Red, to Green, to Blue.
        When button 3 is pushed, the LED will stop blinking.

here im trying to debug some of the functionality of the code since the final output is not expected.
the button press will output the bit value for mapping in the main code.

# RED
all_off(); pmoda_write(pin_red, 1); time.sleep(1)

# GREEN
all_off(); pmoda_write(pin_green, 1); time.sleep(1)

# BLUE
all_off(); pmoda_write(pin_blue, 1); time.sleep(1)

all_off()


above is testing to make sure all the pins are able to be activated one by one,  
further debugging why RGBled wont change colors


all_off()
pmoda_write(pin_red, 0)   # if nothing happens, try 0


checking the RBGled is active his or active low.
